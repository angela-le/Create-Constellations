INSTRUCTIONS
Create constellations among the stars by pressing mouse to create 
segments. Then reset the star map by pressing the space bar. 

CODING QUALITY AND DESIGN
Coding quality and design are pretty good. Coding quality I used
user defined functions for the stars and commented before my event
functions and all of my arrays and variables above. I went for a 
more simple design approach ellipses would generate with random 
opacities at random sizes. The setting is easily defined and the 
game allows for a more creative aspect than a goal aspect comparatively 
to a game. This is more like a interactive do it yourself art piece.
